In 2016, I became part of [SK Hynix inc.](https://www.skhynix.com/). as an Embedded Software Engineer, primarily focusing on the development of SSD Firmware. In 2021, I pioneered the PE9110, marking the advent of SK Hynix's novel SSD architecture.

The focus of my research is on the memory/storage system. My goal is to improve its performance, energy-efficiency, and reliability. With 7 years of experience in memory technology, I have been granted 10 U.S. patents for storage system design and I have an additional 1 patent applications pending.

I obtained my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science and Engineering from [Sogang University](https://sogang.ac.kr/index.do) in 2014 and 2016, respectively. Throughout my postgraduate studies, I had the privilege of collaborating with [Prof. Juho Kim](https://cslab.sogang.ac.kr/cslab/index.html).
