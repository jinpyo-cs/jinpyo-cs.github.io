The data center market will continue to show high growth. In addition, Machine learning and Artificial intelligence increase the demand for more efficient data-centric system. This requires sustainable and efficient green power solutions. The company I am currently working for(SK hynix inc.) is also adhering to eco-friendly management policy. In this context, my research focuses on scalable and efficient storage system for reducing carbon emissions and memory/storage hierarchy with proper emerging memory technologies.

Memory/storage device have a trade off between performance and power consumption. In addition, temperature of the device can limit its performance.

As energy consumption by cooling data center IT equipment can be over 40% of total energy consumption.
