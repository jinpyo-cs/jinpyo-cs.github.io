The datacenter market will continue to show high growth. In addition, Machine learning and Artificial intelligence increase the demand for more efficient data-centric system. This requires sustainable and efficient green power solutions. The company I am currently working for(SK hynix inc.) is also adhering to eco-friendly management policy. In this context, my research focuses on scalable and efficient storage system for reducing carbon emissions and memory/storage hierarchy with proper emerging memory technologies.



Scalable and efficient storage system for reducing carbon emissions
======

Storage continues to play a significant role in enterprise operation. As energy consumption by cooling data center IT equipment can be over 40% of total energy consumption of data center. The challenge is that 
the heat can be generated by operations such as read, write and erase in lots of device. The objective of this research is to architect system to improve the power consumption, performance, and reliability.

Memory/storage hierarchy with proper emerging memory technologies
======

New and increasingly important data-centric workloads, such as AI/ML, IoT, and HPC demand tremendous throughput at a reasonable price. These cannot be handle by the current memory/storage hierarchy of DRAM and flash. By combining different memory technologies, heterogeneous memory architectures allow today’s systems to take advantage of the strengths of each technology — namely, in terms of latency, bandwidth, capacity, persistence or cost. As a result, applications may benefit from improved performance, energy-efficiency, and cost trade-offs.

There are differential characteristics of memory devices such as DRAM, PMEM and Flash. These factors affect efficiency of memory/storage system which is consists of heterogeneous memories.

1) Granularity of operation - Block vs Bytes

2) Latency

3) Cost

4) Volatile and Non-volatile

Still, exploiting the full potential of heterogeneous memory architectures poses significant challenges. Since heterogeneous memory architectures introduce dramatic disruptions to the usual memory hierarchy assumptions that have guided decades of system and software design, we need to rethink the full system stack to embrace the new era of memory heterogeneity. 


Recoverable persistent memory for crash consistency

Maintaining the consistency of data on persistent memory requires data persistence, write ordering and transaction atomicity. The challenge of determining the optimal way to recover persistent memory from crash is driven by a trade-off between recovery time and overall performance.
