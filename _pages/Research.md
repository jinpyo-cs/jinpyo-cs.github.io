The data center market will continue to show high growth. In addition, Machine learning and Artificial intelligence increase the demand for more efficient data-centric system. This requires sustainable and efficient green power solutions. The company I am currently working for(SK hynix inc.) is also adhering to eco-friendly management policy. In this context, my research focuses on scalable and efficient memory/storage system for reducing carbon emissions.
