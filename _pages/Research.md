The data center market will continue to show high growth. In addition, Machine learning and Artificial intelligence increase the demand for more efficient data-centric system. This requires sustainable and efficient green power solutions. The company I am currently working for(SK hynix inc.) is also adhering to eco-friendly management policy. In this context, my research focuses on scalable and efficient storage system for reducing carbon emissions and memory/storage hierarchy with proper emerging memory technologies.



Scalable and efficient storage system for reducing carbon emissions

Storage continues to play a significant role in  As energy consumption by cooling data center IT equipment can be over 40% of total energy consumption. The challenge is that the heat can be generated by operations like read/write/erase in lots of device. The objective of this research is to architect system to improve the power consumption, performance, and reliability.

Memory/storage hierarchy with proper emerging memory technologies

1) Granularity (bytes vs block)
2) Latency (high tail latency)
3) Cost
By combining different memory technologies, heterogeneous memory architectures allow today’s systems to take advantage of the strengths of each technology — namely, in terms of latency, bandwidth, capacity, persistence or cost. As a result, applications may benefit from improved performance, energy-efficiency, and cost trade-offs.
Still, exploiting the full potential of heterogeneous memory architectures poses significant challenges. Since heterogeneous memory architectures introduce dramatic disruptions to the usual memory hierarchy assumptions that have guided decades of system and software design, we need to rethink the full system stack to embrace the new era of memory heterogeneity. 


Recoverable persistent memory for crash consistency
======

Maintaining the consistency of data on persistent memory requires data persistence, write ordering and transaction atomicity. The challenge of determining the optimal way to recover persistent memory from crash is driven by a trade-off between recovery time and overall performance.
