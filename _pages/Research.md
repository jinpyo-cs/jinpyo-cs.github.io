The data center market will continue to show high growth. In addition, Machine learning and Artificial intelligence increase the demand for more efficient data-centric system. This requires sustainable and efficient green power solutions. The company I am currently working for(SK hynix inc.) is also adhering to eco-friendly management policy. In this context, my research focuses on scalable and efficient storage system for reducing carbon emissions and memory/storage hierarchy with proper emerging memory technologies.

As energy consumption by cooling data center IT equipment can be over 40% of total energy consumption. The challenge is that the heat can be generated by operations like read/write/erase in lots of device. Memory/storage hierarchy can provide caching, which hides a operation in lower level storage. The objective of this research is to architect system to improve the power consumption, performance, and reliabilty.
